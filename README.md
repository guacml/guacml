# GuacML aka "Rails for ML"

Automate typical DS/ML workflow, hide the boilerplate, use sensible defaults, but expose ways to customize them ("convention over configuration").

1. Load data
  - CSV
  - ... (later versions)
2. Explore
  - Automated plots and table of stats for each feature
3. Clean
4. Engineer features
5. Train and compare models
6. Repeat
7. Deploy

Ideally, steps 2-3 should be semi-automated (part of 4 as well).
