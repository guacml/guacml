General:
- Disk caching
- xg boost said it's only a single thread version. Instructions in doc/build.md


Timeseries:
- split train, CV, and holdout by timestamp (configurable)
- configurable backtesting

Charts:
- better charts for regression problems

Refactoring:
- Dataset should just be df + metadata about columns
- models should return dfs, not ndarrays
- current Dataset => Guac
- replace long arglists with a Config object
- re-organize module structure
- replace prints with logger
- lint
