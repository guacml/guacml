Data size:
- Start an example with a large dataset.

General:
- xg boost said it's only a single thread version. Instructions in doc/build.md

Timeseries:
- split train, CV, and holdout by timestamp (configurable)
- configurable backtesting

Charts:
- better charts for regression problems

Refactoring:
- Dataset should just be df + metadata about columns
- models should return dfs, not ndarrays
- current Dataset => Guac
- replace long arglists with a Config object
- re-organize module structure
- replace prints with logger
- lint

Disk Caching:
- Would be great to be able to store some hyper parameter optimization iterations
 to disk and later add more. But it's not straightforward, as we have two steps of
 hyper parameter optimization. One before and one after feature selection.
 We could also make the features part of the hyperparamters and then only
 do one big hyper parameter optimization. But the implications are hard to foresee.
